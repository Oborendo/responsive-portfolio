# Responsive Portfolio

This assignment required me to use what I know about html, css, and bootstrap to make a website with multiple pages that use elements from bootstrap to link them all together and make them look good. I used a navbar to introduce the site as well as links so that anyone can move between all the pages freely, with me floating the links to the right. The assignment also required me to make sure that all the pages look good when viewed through a mobile device, though I wasn't able to get around to making that functionality happen yet. I used many sections so that I can hold multiple elements together without them interfering with each other so that everything can continue looking clean.
